        <br/>
        <p>We are a small team of UCSD undergraduate students who came together by chance during the Summer 2023 Developer Internship here at the San Diego Super-Computer Center. Many of us were new to Android Studio and the responsibilities we took on were even more intimidating.  However, by dedicating time to getting to know each other more, our trust and reliance evolved. Not everything went smoothly nor was it perfect, but we managed to push through our hurdles as a team. Below are the members of Boston Tea Party, each one essential to the success of this project.</p>
